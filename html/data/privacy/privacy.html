<p id="english"><strong>Dear Website Visitors</strong>,<br>
To ensure that you feel safe and comfortable when browsing our website, we would like to inform you about how we handle your personal data.
This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, process, and disclose your information, including personal information, in
conjunction with your access to and use of our website.<br><br>
<strong>Data</strong> <strong>Controller</strong><br>
When this policy mentions “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to Jacobs University Bremen gGmbH, Campus Ring 1,
28759 Bremen, Germany, the company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the “Data Controller”).<br><br>
<strong>Storing of IP Addresses</strong><br>
Protecting your privacy is very important to us. We use information that we receive and store during your visit
to our website exclusively for internal purposes and to improve the design of the website, including sub-pages.
If necessary for the purpose of defending against attacks that impair the functionality of our website
(hacker attacks, malware, denial of service attacks, spam), we may access your computer’s IP address for this purpose alone,
which is stored by our telecommunications provider as a security measure for a period of seven days.
After this period has elapsed, we will either delete or anonymize the IP address.
The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR.<br><br>
<strong>Usage Information</strong><br>
When you visit our website, we temporarily store usage information on our web server for statistical purposes
in the form of a log in order to improve the quality of our website. This data record consists of:<br>
• &nbsp; &nbsp;The page from which the file was requested<br>
• &nbsp; &nbsp;The name of the file<br>
• &nbsp; &nbsp;The date and time the file was accessed<br>
• &nbsp; &nbsp;The quantity of data transferred<br>
• &nbsp; &nbsp;The status of access (file transfered, file not found)<br>
• &nbsp; &nbsp;A description of the type of web browser used to access the file<br>
• &nbsp; &nbsp;The IP address of the computer accessing the file, shortened by the last three digits<br>
We use this information to enable access to our website, to control and administer our systems, and to improve the design of our website.
The data stored is stored in anonymized form. This means it is not possible to create personal user profiles based on this information.
Data about individuals or their individual behavior is not collected.<br><br>
<strong>Data Transfers to Third Parties</strong><br>
We do not transfer your personal data to third parties without your express consent.<br><br>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files that can be stored and accessed on your device.
A distinction is made between session cookies, which are deleted as soon as you close your browser,
and permanent cookies, which are stored after each individual session.
Cookies may contain data that make it possible to recognize the device used to access our site across multiple visits.
In some cases, however, cookies only contain information related to certain settings that are not personally identifiable.<br>
We use both session cookies and permanent cookies on our website.
This processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6(1)(F) of the GDPR and in the interest of optimizing or enabling the use of
and adapting the appearance of our website.<br>You can configure your browser so that it informs you when cookies are being saved,
thereby making the use of cookies more transparent. You can also delete cookies at any time via the corresponding browser setting
and prevent new cookies from being saved. Please note that if you disable the use of cookies, our website may not display properly
and some of its features may no longer be supported.<br><br>
<strong>Google Analytics</strong><br>
We create pseudonymized user profiles with the help of Google Analytics to ensure that our website is designed to meet your needs.
Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your device and can be accessed by us.
This allows us to recognize and count returning visitors.
This data is processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(F) of the GDPR and Art. 15(3) of the German Telemedia Act (“Telemediengesetz”)
and in the interest of knowing how often our website has been accessed by different users.<br><br>
The information generated by the cookie pertaining to your use of this website is usually transmitted to and saved on a server
operated by Google located within the United States. However, since we have activated IP anonymization on this website,
your IP address will first be shortened by Google before the data is transferred outside of the European Union.
Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transferred to a Google server in the USA and first shortened there
(whereby an appropriate level of data protection exists pursuant to Art. 45(1) of the GDPR through Google’s participation
in the Privacy Shield program). In addition, we have entered into a data processing agreement with Google Inc. (USA) in accordance
with Art. 28 of the GDPR. As a result, Google may only use this information strictly for the purpose of analyzing the use of our
website for us and compiling reports regarding this website activity.<br>
You can object to this processing at any time. To do so, please use one of the following options:<br>
1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can prevent cookies from being saved to your device using the respective
setting in your browser software; we would like to explicitly state, however, that you may not be able to
completely use all of this website’s features if you deactivate cookies.<br>
2) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Besides taking this step, you can prevent the data generated by the cookie related to your
use of this website (including your IP address) from being sent to and processed by Google by downloading and installing
the browser plug-in available here: (<a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" class="ext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout<span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a>)<br>
3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can also prevent Google Analytics from collecting this data by clicking on the following link.
Doing so will store an “opt-out cookie” on your device, which will prevent the collection of your data for this and all future visits:
<a href="javascript:gaOptout()"> Click here to opt-out of your data being collected and processed by Google Analytics.</a><br><br>
<strong>Google Tag Manager, DoubleClick</strong><br>
Furthermore, we use Google Tag Manager on our website for personalized, interest-based, and location-based online advertising.
Google Tag Manager allows us to target visitors to our website as part of marketing campaigns on our partners’ websites.
When you visit our website, we access identifiers that allow us to recognize your browser or device, analyze your IP address,
and/or store a unique identifier as a small text file (known as a third party cookie) on your device.
Your usage behavior is tracked when you visit various websites. The identifying attributes are pseudonymized.
If you are logged in with your Google account, these attributes can be linked directly to your profile.
Google may link and store your visits to our website with your personal attributes in order to display targeted
advertising to you on other websites. This also allows Google to determine if you have previously visited our website.
Your device and browser are recognized by Google, for example, when you visit a website that displays ads through
Google’s advertising network. Such processing is carried out on the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 6(1)(A) of the GDPR.
You can withdraw your consent to retargeting on our website, which you have given via our cookie banner, at any time.
Users can deactivate DoubleClick remarketing pixels by calling up the deactivation page for DoubleClick (<a class="ext" href="https://www.google.de/settings/ads/onweb#display_optout" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.google.de/settings/ads/onweb#display_optout</a>) or on this deactivation page (<a class="ext" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>).<br><br>
