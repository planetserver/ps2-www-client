We would like to inform you about the management of your personal data in accordance with Art. 13 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<br /><br />
<strong>Controller</strong><br />
The controller responsible for the described data collection and processing is named in the <a href="https://www.jacobs-university.de/impressum">imprint</a>.<br /><br />
<strong>Storage of Your IP address</strong><br />
We store the IP address transmitted by your web browser for a period of seven (7) days, strictly for the purpose of identifying, 
restricting and eliminating attacks on our website. After seven (7) days, we delete or anonymize your IP address. 
The legal basis for the processing of this personal data is provided for in Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. f GDPR.<br /><br />
<strong>Usage Information</strong><br />
When you visit our website, we temporarily store usage information on our web server for statistical purposes 
in the form of a log in order to improve the quality of our website. This data record consists of:<br />
• &nbsp; &nbsp;The page from which the file was requested<br />
• &nbsp; &nbsp;The name of the file<br />
• &nbsp; &nbsp;The date and time the file was accessed<br />
• &nbsp; &nbsp;The quantity of data transferred<br />
• &nbsp; &nbsp;The status of access (file transfered, file not found)<br />
• &nbsp; &nbsp;A description of the type of web browser used to access the file<br />
• &nbsp; &nbsp;The IP address of the computer accessing the file, shortened by the last three digits<br />
We use this information to enable access to our website, to control and administer our systems, and to improve the design of our website. 
The data stored is stored in anonymized form. This means it is not possible to create personal user profiles based on this information. 
Data about individuals or their individual behavior is not collected.<br /><br />
<strong>Data Transfers to Third Parties</strong><br />
We do not transfer your personal data to third parties without your express consent.<br /><br />
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files that can be stored and accessed on your device. 
A distinction is made between session cookies, which are deleted as soon as you close your browser, 
and permanent cookies, which are stored after each individual session. 
Cookies may contain data that make it possible to recognize the device used to access our site across multiple visits. 
In some cases, however, cookies only contain information related to certain settings that are not personally identifiable.<br>
We use both session cookies and permanent cookies on our website. 
This processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6(1)(F) of the GDPR and in the interest of optimizing or enabling the use of 
and adapting the appearance of our website.<br>You can configure your browser so that it informs you when cookies are being saved, 
thereby making the use of cookies more transparent. You can also delete cookies at any time via the corresponding browser setting 
and prevent new cookies from being saved. Please note that if you disable the use of cookies, our website may not display properly 
and some of its features may no longer be supported.<br><br>
<strong>Google Analytics</strong><br>
We create pseudonymized user profiles with the help of Google Analytics to ensure that our website is designed to meet your needs. 
Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your device and can be accessed by us. 
This allows us to recognize and count returning visitors. 
This data is processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(F) of the GDPR and Art. 15(3) of the German Telemedia Act (“Telemediengesetz”) 
and in the interest of knowing how often our website has been accessed by different users.<br><br>
The information generated by the cookie pertaining to your use of this website is usually transmitted to and saved on a server 
operated by Google located within the United States. However, since we have activated IP anonymization on this website, 
your IP address will first be shortened by Google before the data is transferred outside of the European Union. 
Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transferred to a Google server in the USA and first shortened there 
(whereby an appropriate level of data protection exists pursuant to Art. 45(1) of the GDPR through Google’s participation 
in the Privacy Shield program). In addition, we have entered into a data processing agreement with Google Inc. (USA) in accordance 
with Art. 28 of the GDPR. As a result, Google may only use this information strictly for the purpose of analyzing the use of our 
website for us and compiling reports regarding this website activity.<br>
You can object to this processing at any time. To do so, please use one of the following options:<br>
1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can prevent cookies from being saved to your device using the respective 
setting in your browser software; we would like to explicitly state, however, that you may not be able to 
completely use all of this website’s features if you deactivate cookies.<br>
2) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Besides taking this step, you can prevent the data generated by the cookie related to your 
use of this website (including your IP address) from being sent to and processed by Google by downloading and installing 
the browser plug-in available here: (<a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" class="ext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout<span class="ext" aria-label="(link is external)"></span></a>)<br>
3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can also prevent Google Analytics from collecting this data by clicking on the following link. 
Doing so will store an “opt-out cookie” on your device, which will prevent the collection of your data for this and all future visits:
